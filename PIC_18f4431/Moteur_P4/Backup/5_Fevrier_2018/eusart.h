      @Summary
        Read a byte of data from the EUSART1.

      @Description
        This routine reads a byte of data from the EUSART1.

      @Preconditions
        EUSART1_Initialize() function should have been called
        before calling this function. The transfer status should be checked to see
        if the receiver is not empty before calling this function.
	
        EUSART1_DataReady is a macro which checks if any byte is received.
        Call this macro before using this function.

      @Param
        None

      @Returns
        A data byte received by the driver.
